    "## Election forecasting problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is the natural method of blending prior information (from previous polls or elections) with current results, either from an isolated survey or from a sequence of surveys taken at regular intervals  _(tracking)_ approaching election day. In the simplest setting, in a given district, the vector of number of votes cast for the $m$ political parties contesting in a multi-party election follows an $m$-dimensional multinomial distribution. Hence we consider problems in analysis of election-related data as representative of Bayesian treatment for the multinomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistically forecasting vote counts requires many data analytical techniques, including methods for aggregating results from diverse electoral districts and supervised learning methods to take into account other sources of information and/or variability such as socio-economical factors and geo-spatial influences. Political representation systems transforming number of votes into actual final results, such as number of seats in a Parliament modulated by d'Hondt rule as in Spanish elections or electoral votes in the US presidential elections, add an additional layer of complexity. In any case, election forecasting offers an ample field for Data Scientists.\n",
    "\n",
